        <div class="col-lg-6 p">It was the first time when I met you, I still remember that day and will probably remember it for the rest of my life as it was one of the 
          bestest days of my life,even though that time i never imagined that you will become such an important person of my life, but now when I
          look back to that day, I think it is a memory from which i will never get bored. P.S. It was also our first bunk of college life...</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 p" style="margin-left: 4rem;">So,here's our first pic together, we don't have many but still even if we had a million, it will still hold a special place in my heart....
          and one more reason because of which this picture is special is that on this very day I realised that "I have feelings for you", and I must say 
          it was a very special moment when I look back to it now, I must say that it was the beginning of the most wonderful and special
          relationship that I have with you not only of my love but also my Bestest Friend.... </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 p">Ok, here we are, I know you won't like it here but this pic is a 
          very special picture for me, I was slowly felling in love with you and we went on a casual data
        ,although it wasn't that fruitful and of course, you went to buy toothpaste after the dataüòÇ,but still
        its one of our most beautiful pictures together.üòã

          but I never told you thatüòù. We have a lot of pictures together of that day and it was quite
          difficult for me to select one, but that day I knew that I truly loved you, and its also a fact I never
          said you...

      <div class="pic-text p">2019 was a very special year for me, not only because I met you, but also because

          jokes apart as we couldn't meet during covid(P.S.We still can't meetüò¢), Video calls
          was our lifeline and This in one of my favourite screenshots of a such video call,
          I still remember you were angry that day as I did something stupid(Again), and we ended up saying
          sorry to each other in this video call.....
