      <p>A kindly spoken word means so much when from you,</p>
      <p>it comforts my weary heart or when I’m feeling blue.</p>
      <p>A song can make our hearts dance in pretty fast-paced clips</p> 
      <p>when we hear the melody of our love’s unconquerable grips.</p>
      <p>Words could lift my spirits and sweet compassion find;</p>
      <p>put your hand in mine alone and peace will fill my mind.</p>
      <p>A smile, a word, a song, a look – seem small little things</p>
      <p>but when love sparks an action, what blessings they bring......</p></div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 p">It was the first time when I met you, I still remember that day and will probably remember it for the rest of my life as it was one of the 
          bestest days of my life,even though that time i never imagined that you will become such an important person of my life, but now when I
          look back to that day, I think it is a memory from which i will never get bored. P.S. It was also our first bunk of college life...</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 p" style="margin-left: 4rem;">So,here's our first pic together, we don't have many but still even if we had a million, it will still hold a special place in my heart....
          and one more reason because of which this picture is special is that on this very day I realised that "I have feelings for you", and I must say 
          it was a very special moment when I look back to it now, I must say that it was the beginning of the most wonderful and special
          relationship that I have with you not only of my love but also my Bestest Friend.... </div>
      </div>
      <div id="tcs" class="row pic-text">
        <div class="col-lg-6 p">Ok, here we are, I know you won't like it here but this pic is a 
          very special picture for me, I was slowly felling in love with you and we went on a casual data
        ,although it wasn't that fruitful and of course, you went to buy toothpaste after the data😂,but still
        its one of our most beautiful pictures together.😋

        <div class="col-lg-6 p">Firstly,you were looking gorgeous that day, absolutely beautiful
          but I never told you that😝. We have a lot of pictures together of that day and it was quite
          difficult for me to select one, but that day I knew that I truly loved you, and its also a fact I never
          said you...

      <div class="pic-text p">2019 was a very special year for me, not only because I met you, but also because 
        I started to fight my own demons and it marked the start of our hope-so Eternal Journey.

        but I will always remember this year for a very speical reason: I found the love of my life 
        in this very year.... Apart from all the hurdles and calamities
        we drifted together through the year successfully with standing side by
        side to each other in all situations....

          jokes apart as we couldn't meet during covid(P.S.We still can't meet😢), Video calls
          was our lifeline and This in one of my favourite screenshots of a such video call,
          I still remember you were angry that day as I did something stupid(Again), and we ended up saying
          sorry to each other in this video call.....

          On this day, I believed that the bad days are really behind us and we were ready to stay together
          forever(🚨Cliche Alert).... And its a very big reason that I get hope and motivation from this picture 
          of yours... Apart from the fact that you are looking beautiful,
